#📊 dbt First Project

Welcome to my first dbt project!
This repository is where I’m learning how to use dbt (Data Build Tool) connected to Snowflake, following best practices for analytics engineering.

The project follows the standard dbt structure and includes models, seeds, macros, snapshots, tests, and more: providing a complete environment to practice building data transformations and maintaining data quality.

#🚀 Project Overview

This project serves as a hands-on introduction to:

- Building SQL-based data transformations with dbt
- Organizing models into a modular project
- Managing dependencies with packages.yml
- Running tests and enforcing data quality
- Creating snapshots to track historical data changes
- Using dbt with a Snowflake warehouse
